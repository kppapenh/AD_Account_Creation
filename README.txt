This is a powershell program that allows you to generate new AD accounts based on a unique identifier.  It utilizes .CSV files in order to pull, format, and store data.  It connects with active directory and pulls current account infromation from there.  Another .CSV needs to be generated from a database with active students.  It then compares the two files.  If an account does not exist in AD, but does in the student file, it will create a new account.  If the opposite of this occurs, it will disable the account and move it to a disabled OU.  It utilizes the office field to house a counter that is started once the account is disabled.  After 90 days the account will be deleted from AD.
This is meant to run nightly.  Everynight and email will be seny to IT staff with a creation, disabling, and deletion file.  This shows the account movement for that night.  It will also keep a running list of all account created in a specified location to reference back on.
